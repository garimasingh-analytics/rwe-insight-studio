# RWE Insight Studio

A cohort-driven Real-World Evidence (RWE) analytics web application for exploring
treatment effectiveness and healthcare outcomes using real-world patient data.

## 🔍 Problem
Real-world healthcare data is complex, heterogeneous, and difficult to explore
without technical skills. RWE analysts often spend more time preparing cohorts
than analyzing outcomes.

## 🎯 Solution
RWE Insight Studio enables users to:
- Upload real-world patient datasets
- Define and save patient cohorts
- Compare outcomes and hospitalization rates
- Generate automatic narrative insights

The app is designed to mirror real RWE and HEOR workflows used in pharma and healthcare analytics teams.

## 🧠 Key Features
- CSV upload with schema validation
- Dynamic cohort builder
- Saved cohort comparison
- Outcome and hospitalization analysis
- Auto-generated insight narratives
- Scales to 100,000+ patient records (synthetic data)

## 🗂 Dataset
Synthetic real-world evidence dataset with:
- 100,000 patient records
- 20+ diseases
- Diagnosis-linked treatments
- Longitudinal follow-up

⚠️ Synthetic data used to preserve patient privacy.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Client-side data processing
- Chart-based visualization
- In-memory cohort management
